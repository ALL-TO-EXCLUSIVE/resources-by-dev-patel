# Unit 1: Introduction

## 1. Concept of Operating Systems

An **Operating System (OS)** is a software layer that manages computer hardware and provides services for computer programs. It acts as an intermediary between users and the computer hardware, ensuring efficient and fair resource allocation.

**Key Functions of an OS:**

- **Process Management:** Handles the creation, scheduling, and termination of processes.
- **Memory Management:** Manages the allocation and deallocation of memory spaces as needed by programs.
- **File System Management:** Controls the reading, writing, creation, and deletion of files.
- **Device Management:** Manages device communication via their respective drivers.
- **Security and Access Control:** Protects data and resources from unauthorized access.

## 2. Generations of Operating Systems

Operating systems have evolved through several generations:

1. **First Generation (1940s-1950s):** No operating systems; machines were programmed using machine language.
2. **Second Generation (1950s-1960s):** Introduction of batch processing systems; jobs were collected and processed in groups.
3. **Third Generation (1960s-1970s):** Multiprogramming and time-sharing systems allowed multiple users to interact with the computer simultaneously.
4. **Fourth Generation (1980s-Present):** Personal computers became widespread; GUIs introduced; development of networked and distributed systems.

## 3. Types of Operating Systems

Operating systems can be categorized based on their functionalities and applications:

- **Batch Operating Systems:** Execute batches of jobs without user interaction.
- **Time-Sharing Operating Systems:** Allow multiple users to use the system interactively at the same time.
- **Distributed Operating Systems:** Manage a group of distinct computers and make them appear as a single computer.
- **Real-Time Operating Systems:** Provide immediate processing and responses to input, crucial for applications like embedded systems.
- **Network Operating Systems:** Provide services to computers connected to a network.

## 4. OS Services

Operating systems offer various services to users and programs:

- **Program Execution:** Load and execute programs.
- **I/O Operations:** Facilitate input and output operations.
- **File System Manipulation:** Manage files and directories.
- **Communication:** Enable processes to communicate with each other.
- **Error Detection:** Monitor and respond to system errors.
- **Resource Allocation:** Allocate resources to multiple users or jobs as needed.

## 5. System Calls

**System Calls** are the programming interface between a program and the operating system. They allow user-level processes to request services from the OS kernel, such as file operations, process control, and communication.

**Common System Call Categories:**

- **Process Control:** `fork()`, `exit()`
- **File Management:** `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, `close()`
- **Device Management:** `ioctl()`, `read()`, `write()`
- **Information Maintenance:** `getpid()`, `alarm()`, `sleep()`
- **Communication:** `pipe()`, `shmget()`, `mmap()`

## 6. Structure of an OS

Operating systems can have different structures:

- **Monolithic:** Entire OS works in kernel space; all functionalities are in a single layer.
- **Layered:** OS is divided into layers, each built upon the lower ones, with the innermost layer being the hardware.
- **Microkernel:** Minimal kernel running basic services; other services run in user space, enhancing modularity and security.

## 7. Concept of Virtual Machine

A **Virtual Machine (VM)** is an emulation of a computer system. It provides the functionality of a physical computer, allowing multiple OS instances to run on a single physical machine. VMs are widely used for testing, development, and efficient resource utilization.

## 8. Case Study: UNIX and Windows Operating Systems

**UNIX:**

- **Architecture:** Follows a layered approach with a simple, modular design.
- **Features:** Multiuser, multitasking capabilities; strong emphasis on text-based processing and scripting.
- **File System:** Hierarchical file system with a root directory.

**Windows:**

- **Architecture:** Hybrid structure combining monolithic and microkernel aspects.
- **Features:** User-friendly GUI; extensive hardware support; wide range of software compatibility.
- **File System:** Uses NTFS, supporting large files and advanced features like file permissions.
