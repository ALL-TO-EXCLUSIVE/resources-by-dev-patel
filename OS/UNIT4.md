# Unit 4: Deadlocks

## 1. Deadlock Characterization

A **deadlock** is a situation in operating systems where a set of processes become permanently blocked because each process is waiting for a resource that another process in the set holds. This results in a standstill where none of the processes can proceed.

**Necessary Conditions for Deadlock:**

1. **Mutual Exclusion:** At least one resource must be held in a non-shareable mode; only one process can use the resource at any given time.
2. **Hold and Wait:** A process holding at least one resource is waiting to acquire additional resources held by other processes.
3. **No Preemption:** Resources cannot be forcibly taken from processes; they must be released voluntarily.
4. **Circular Wait:** A set of processes exist such that each process is waiting for a resource held by the next process in the set, forming a circular chain.

All four conditions must hold simultaneously for a deadlock to occur.

## 2. Methods for Handling Deadlocks

Operating systems employ various strategies to handle deadlocks:
- **Deadlock Ignorance:** A common strategy is to ignore deadlocks and continue execution, often leading to unexpected behavior.
- **Deadlock Prevention:** Proactively negate one of the necessary conditions to prevent deadlocks.
- **Deadlock Avoidance:** Dynamically analyze resource allocation to ensure the system remains in a safe state.
- **Deadlock Detection and Recovery:** Allow deadlocks to occur, detect them, and take action to recover.

## 3. Deadlock Prevention

Deadlock prevention involves ensuring that at least one of the necessary conditions for deadlock cannot hold:

- **Mutual Exclusion:** Not always possible to eliminate, especially for non-shareable resources.
- **Hold and Wait:** Require processes to request all required resources at once, ensuring they don't hold resources while waiting for others.
- **No Preemption:** Allow the system to preempt resources from processes, for example, by forcibly taking a resource from a process.
- **Circular Wait:** Impose an ordering on resource types and require processes to request resources in a specific order, preventing circular chains.

By negating one or more of these conditions, the system can prevent deadlocks from occurring.

## 4. Deadlock Ignorance

Deadlock ignorance is a strategy where the operating system ignores deadlocks and continues execution. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential system failures. It is a riskier option than prevention or avoidance, as it can lead to system instability and resource wastage.

## 5. Deadlock Avoidance

Deadlock avoidance requires the system to make decisions dynamically about whether to grant resource requests based on the current state and potential future states. The system must ensure that it never enters an unsafe state where deadlocks are possible.

**Banker's Algorithm:** A well-known deadlock avoidance algorithm that simulates resource allocation for processes and determines if the system will remain in a safe state after allocation. If granting a resource request leads to an unsafe state, the request is denied.

## 6. Deadlock Detection

If the system does not employ prevention or avoidance strategies, deadlocks can still occur. In such cases, the system must have mechanisms to detect deadlocks.

**Detection Methods:**

- **Resource Allocation Graphs:** For systems with a single instance of each resource type, cycles in the graph indicate deadlocks.
- **Wait-for Graphs:** A simplified version of the resource allocation graph where nodes represent processes, and edges represent waiting relationships. Cycles in this graph also indicate deadlocks.

The system can periodically check for cycles in these graphs to detect deadlocks.

## 7. Recovery from Deadlock

Once a deadlock is detected, the system must take action to recover:

- **Process Termination:** Abort one or more processes involved in the deadlock to break the cycle. This can be done by terminating all deadlocked processes or one at a time until the deadlock is resolved.
- **Resource Preemption:** Temporarily preempt resources from processes and allocate them to others until the deadlock is broken. This requires mechanisms to rollback processes to safe states and ensure that preempted resources are handled correctly.

Recovery strategies must be carefully designed to minimize the impact on system performance and ensure data integrity.
