# Unit 5: Memory Management

Memory management is a critical function of an operating system (OS) that handles or manages primary memory. It keeps track of each memory location, whether allocated or free, and manages the allocation and deallocation of memory spaces as needed by various programs to optimize overall system performance.

## 1. Memory Management Strategies

The OS employs various strategies to manage memory efficiently:

- **Contiguous Memory Allocation:** Allocates a single contiguous section of memory to a process. This method is simple but can lead to fragmentation and inefficient utilization of memory.

- **Paging:** Divides the process's memory into fixed-size pages and the physical memory into frames of the same size. Pages are loaded into any available memory frames, eliminating the need for contiguous allocation and reducing fragmentation.

- **Segmentation:** Divides the process's memory into variable-sized segments based on logical divisions such as functions or data structures. Each segment is loaded into a contiguous area of memory, but unlike paging, segments vary in size.

- **Virtual Memory:** Extends the available memory by using a portion of the disk as an extension of RAM, allowing the system to run larger applications or multiple applications simultaneously. It relies on techniques like paging and segmentation to manage memory efficiently.

## 2. Swapping

Swapping is a memory management technique where processes are temporarily moved from main memory to a backing store (disk) and then brought back into memory for continued execution. This is used to free up memory for other processes and is essential for multiprogramming environments.

**Key Points:**

- **Rollout/Rollin:** Entire processes are swapped out and in, which can lead to high overhead if processes are large.

- **Swapping with Paging:** Only the necessary pages of a process are swapped, reducing overhead and improving efficiency.

## 3. Fragmentation

Fragmentation refers to the condition of memory where free memory is divided into small blocks and is interspersed by allocated memory. It comes in two forms:

- **External Fragmentation:** Occurs when there is enough total free memory space to satisfy a request, but the available spaces are not contiguous; thus, the request cannot be fulfilled.

- **Internal Fragmentation:** Happens when allocated memory may have some unused space due to the allocation of fixed-sized blocks, leading to wasted space within the allocated regions.

**Solutions to Fragmentation:**

- **Compaction:** Rearranging memory contents to place all free memory together in one large block, which helps in reducing external fragmentation.

- **Paging and Segmentation:** These techniques help in minimizing fragmentation by allowing non-contiguous memory allocation.

## 4. Paging

Paging is a memory management scheme that eliminates the need for contiguous allocation of physical memory. It avoids external fragmentation and the need for compaction.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Page Table:** Maintains the mapping between the process's logical pages and the physical frames in memory.

- **Page Fault:** Occurs when a process tries to access a page that is not currently in memory, triggering the OS to load the required page from the disk into memory.

- **TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer):** A cache used to reduce the time taken to access the page table entries, improving the efficiency of memory access.

## 5. Segmentation

Segmentation is a memory management technique that divides the process's memory into segments based on the logical divisions of the program.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Segment Table:** Contains the base address and limit (length) of each segment, used to translate logical addresses to physical addresses.

- **Segmentation Fault:** Occurs when a process tries to access a memory location outside its allocated segment bounds, leading to an error.

## 6. Virtual Memory

Virtual memory is a technique that allows the execution of processes that may not be completely in memory. It separates the user's logical memory from the physical memory, enabling:

- **Demand Paging:** Loads pages into memory only when they are needed, reducing the memory usage and improving system responsiveness.

- **Page Replacement Algorithms:** Determine which pages to swap out when new pages need to be loaded into memory. Common algorithms include:

  - **FIFO (First-In-First-Out):** Replaces the oldest page in memory.

  - **LRU (Least Recently Used):** Replaces the page that has not been used for the longest period.

  - **Optimal Page Replacement:** Replaces the page that will not be used for the longest time in the future (theoretical and not implementable in practice).

**Benefits of Virtual Memory:**

- **Efficient Memory Utilization:** Allows more processes to be loaded into memory by using disk space as an extension of RAM.

- **Isolation and Protection:** Provides process isolation, ensuring that one process cannot interfere with the memory of another.

- **Simplified Memory Management:** Simplifies the programming model by providing a large, uniform address space to processes.
