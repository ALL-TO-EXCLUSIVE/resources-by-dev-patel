# Computer Organization & Architecture - Unit 1 Detailed Notes

## Overview of Register Transfer and Micro-operations

### **1. Register Transfer Language (RTL)**
Register Transfer Language (RTL) is a symbolic notation that describes the micro-operations performed on data stored in registers. It helps in representing how data moves within a CPU.

#### **Basic Concepts of RTL:**
- **Registers**: Small, fast storage elements inside the CPU.
- **Micro-operations**: Operations executed on data stored in registers.
- **Control Signals**: Signals that dictate register operations.

##### **Example of Register Transfer:**
```
R1 <- R2  // Transfer contents of R2 into R1
```
This means the data in register R2 is moved to register R1 without affecting R2.

### **2. Bus and Memory Transfer**
#### **Bus Structure:**
A bus is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer.
- **Data Bus**: Transfers actual data.
- **Address Bus**: Transfers address locations.
- **Control Bus**: Sends control signals.

#### **Memory Transfer:**
Memory transfer operations include:
- **Read Operation:** Fetching data from memory.
- **Write Operation:** Storing data into memory.

##### **Example of Memory Read Operation:**
```
MAR <- Address
MDR <- Memory[MAR]  // Load data from memory into MDR
R1 <- MDR            // Transfer data to Register 1
```

### **3. Arithmetic Micro-operations**
Arithmetic micro-operations perform basic arithmetic computations on register data.

#### **Common Arithmetic Operations:**
| Operation | Description | Example |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Addition | Adds contents of two registers | `R1 <- R1 + R2` |
| Subtraction | Subtracts one register from another | `R1 <- R1 - R2` |
| Increment | Increases register value by 1 | `R1 <- R1 + 1` |
| Decrement | Decreases register value by 1 | `R1 <- R1 - 1` |
| Multiplication | Multiplies values of two registers | `R1 <- R1 * R2` |

### **4. Logic Micro-operations**
Logic micro-operations perform bitwise logical functions such as AND, OR, XOR, and NOT.

#### **Common Logic Operations:**
| Operation | Symbol | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| AND | `∧` | `R1 <- R1 ∧ R2` |
| OR | `∨` | `R1 <- R1 ∨ R2` |
| XOR | `⊕` | `R1 <- R1 ⊕ R2` |
| NOT | `¬` | `R1 <- ¬R1` |

### **5. Shift Micro-operations**
Shift operations move bits within a register.

#### **Types of Shift Operations:**
- **Logical Shift:** Moves bits left or right, inserting zeros in empty spaces.
- **Arithmetic Shift:** Maintains sign for signed numbers.
- **Circular Shift (Rotate):** Wraps shifted bits around to the other side.

##### **Example of Logical Shift Left:**
```
R1 <- shl R1  // Shift left by one position
```

##### **Example of Arithmetic Shift Right:**
```
R1 <- ashr R1  // Arithmetic shift right, maintaining sign bit
```

### **6. Arithmetic Logic Shift Unit (ALU)**
The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a digital circuit that performs arithmetic and logical operations.

#### **Components of ALU:**
1. **Arithmetic Unit**: Handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2. **Logic Unit**: Performs AND, OR, XOR, and NOT operations.
3. **Shift Unit**: Executes shift micro-operations.
4. **Multiplexer**: Selects the required operation.
